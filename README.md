# [Advent of 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)
The goal of this repo is:

1. Having fun: Daily problems are always fun, espiecially when you try to solve them in different languages.
2. Showcasing: I'm not always doing the most optimal solutions but I'm trying to solve each problem differently and (re-)explore different ways of solving.

### Repo archiecure

this repo only includes Java for now but it will soon change to add different languages. I already have solutions in Colab notebooks in python to add.
