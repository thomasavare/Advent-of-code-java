# [Advent of 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)
## The goal of this repo is:

1. Having fun: Daily problems are always fun, espiecially when you try to solve them in different languages.
2. Showcasing: I'm not always doing the most optimal solutions but I'm trying to solve each problem differently and (re-)explore different ways of solving.

### Repo archiecure

This repo only includes Java for now but it will soon change to add different languages. I already have solutions in Colab notebooks in python to add.

## Solutions descriptions

- Day 1:
  - Part 1: Reading a file and formating the content to desired output, Utilisation of ```ArraysList```
  - Part 2: Utilisation of ```HashMap```
- Day 2:
  - Part 1: Marices and looping through matrices
  - Part 2: Matrices and more complex maipulations, more complex comparisons
- Days 3:
  - Part 1: String manipulations and comparisons using ```Pattern``` and ```Matcher``` Classes
  - Part 2: More complex regex matching
- Day 4:
  - Part 1: Creation of own Character Matrix Class ```CharMat``` for simple manipulations. (could have used regex matching)
  - Part 2: Utilisation of Marix class, applying a kernel filter to extract the number of pattern maching of the kernel.
- Day 5: Not done
- Day 6: Not done
- Day 7:
  - Part 1: Utilisation of ```BigInteger``` and ```Queues```, more data formating when reading input file.
