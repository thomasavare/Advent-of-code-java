# [Advent of 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)
## The goal of this repo is:

1. Having fun: Daily problems are always fun, espiecially when you try to solve them in different languages.
2. Showcasing: I'm not always doing the most optimal solutions but I'm trying to solve each problem differently and (re-)explore different ways of solving.

### Repo archiecure

This repo only includes Java for now but it will soon change to add different languages. I already have solutions in Colab notebooks in python to add.

## Solutions descriptions

- Day 1:
  - Part 1: Reading a file and formating the content to desired output, Utilisation of ```ArraysList```
  - Part 2: Utilisation of ```HashMap```
- Day 2:
  - Part 1: Marices and looping through matrices
  - Part 2: Matrices and more complex maipulations, more complex comparisons
- Days 3:
  - Part 1: String manipulations and comparisons using ```Pattern``` and ```Matcher``` Classes
  - Part 2: More complex regex matching
- Day 4:
  - Part 1: Creation of own Character Matrix Class ```CharMat``` for simple manipulations. (could have used regex 
  matching)
  - Part 2: Utilisation of Marix class, applying a kernel filter to extract the number of pattern maching of the kernel.
- Day 5: Not done
- Day 6: Not done
- Day 7:
  - Part 1: Construction of Tree with a custom class, Utilisation of ```long``` and ```ArrayDeque```, more data 
  formating when reading input file.
    - Part 1: (extra): same problem but with operation priority issues solved using Arrays when constructing the tree 
    (I did it because I can't properly read an exercise apparently). Alot of debugging using the IDE debugger made it 
    interesting.
    - Part 2: Same thing globally because there are no priorities between the operations so it's straightforward.
    - To add: prettty print of the trees for better visualization when analyzing what is happening,
- Day 8: Meh
- Day 9: Meh
- Day 10: Fun way: implement graph class and explore algorithm or search algorithm. you can represent everything with a 
directed graph and search more effectively.
  - More effective: you don't actually need the graphs, it's just fun, construct trailheads iteratively with stack or 
  recursively.
